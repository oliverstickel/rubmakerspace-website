=== "About Me"
	
	>"I'm Dirk and I manage the RUB Makerspace. This means that since 2016 I have been taking care of just about everything that doesn't happen directly on the machines and devices: Instead of producing G-code, I write lines of text in emails or project proposals; instead of creating 3D models, I work on networks and PowerPoint presentations. So, unfortunately, unlike the rest of our great team who explain how to use our equipment, guide you and advise you, I'm at the machines far too rarely. Instead, I'm the contact person for collaborations and also sometimes a tour guide through our makerspace - and I hereby cordially invite everyone to join us on a discovery tour!"
