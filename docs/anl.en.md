=== "About Me"
	
	>"Hi, I'm Anna-Lena and you'll probably meet me most of the time in the [wood workshop](holzwerkstatt.en.md). I wanted to become a carpenter when I was a teenager, but I was a little longer in the orientation phase. I enjoy building and tinkering with all sorts of projects and look forward to helping you with your ideas. "It always seems impossible until it is accomplished" - Nelson Mandela.
