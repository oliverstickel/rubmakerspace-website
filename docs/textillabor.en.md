	From time to time, certain machines and equipment may not be available for use due to renovations, expansions, maintenance, repairs or other similar reasons.

Our Textile Lab offers you both manual and digital equipment to create or process different types of textiles. For example, you can have patterns embroidered automatically, cut foils and press them onto fabrics, or even have our Kniterate knit for you. The sewing machine and coverlock can also be used to perform classic sewing work for various applications.
