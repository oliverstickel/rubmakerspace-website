# The Team

The RUB Makerspace team consists of very different people from equally different disciplines. From handicrafts to art, we go all the way to research. Although all team members have disciplinary focuses, they also operate very interdisciplinary in order to be able to jointly oversee and operate the many different [work areas](ort.en.md) of the Makerspace.

>The core task of the entire team is to go on a 'journey of discovery' together with users alongside their projects. Our focus is especially on providing a very diverse infrastructure and the associated basic training for very diverse users and projects. We are more than happy to do this, because we all enjoy experimenting and learning together.
