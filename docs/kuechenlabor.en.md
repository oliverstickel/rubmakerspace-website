In the kitchen lab, everything revolves around cooking, (sustainable) food utilization and culinary experiments. In a professionally equipped stainless steel catering kitchen, you will find all the utensils and equipment that can be used for various applications in the food sector. Whether it's cooking together as a team event, making chocolates with specially created molds or preparing vegan cheese, you are free to let your imagination run wild in the kitchen.  

What you are missing in your own kitchen, you will certainly find in the kitchen laboratory: from the high-performance blender to the combi steamer to the blast freezer and back to the hand blender, the kitchen laboratory has versatile equipment. Anything that meets food hygiene guidelines and is not harmful to humans can be processed in the kitchen laboratory. 


The 16,66 m^2^ small kitchen offers numerous possibilities for cooking due to a clever layout and equipment, but also experimenting with food can become part of the lab. There are hardly any limits to your own project ideas: Drawing color extracts from food, making plastic from milk or using starch as a binder for bioplastics are just a few examples of possible experiments in the kitchen lab.
