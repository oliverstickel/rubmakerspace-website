??? info "How to Navigate the Presentation Slides"

	- Navigate with the blue arrows on the bottom right or via the menu on the bottom left.
	- There are horizontal and vertical slides. You can see which way to go by the blue arrows or in the slide overview.
	- On the keyboard: "Escape" for slide overview, "f" for fullscreen; "s" for "Speaker Notes", arrow keys for navigation, and much more. - Overview of all shortcuts via keystroke "?" for help.
	- On mobile devices: Navigation via swipe gestures possible.
	- If the first slide looks " out of place " (can happen depending on your browser), simply navigate to the next slide and then back again or reload the page. This will fix the problem.
	- Print (paper or PDF) best via the link "Print View" below the slide set. Important: The print view only works correctly in Chromium browsers (for example Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave, etc.).
