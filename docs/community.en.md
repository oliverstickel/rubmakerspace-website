# Community

As far as the workload allows us, we open the RUB Makerspace to all interested people. The Makerspace thus becomes a resource and an open place for all people. This can only succeed in a collaborative way.

## This Is What We Wish from All Makers

- Share your knowledge! Please feel free to [send](kontakt.en.md) photos, text or other materials about what you have built in the Makerspace! 
- Help other makers.
- Especially share what you have learned in the Makerspace. Maybe you can even offer a small workshop about it?
- Help to make the Makerspace a living place where you and others enjoy spending time.
- Leave material (e.g. "still good" leftovers) for the general public in the *treasure boxes* in the Makerspace - more about this at [storage](lager.en.md).
- Contribute to the development of the Makerspace - e.g. via [feedback](feedback.en.md) or useful content for our [working folder](status.en.md#arbeitsordner).
- Think about making your project public, e.g. publish it as "open source" with good documentation.

## The community idea - also worldwide

The RUB makerspace belongs to a large and growing number of [open workshops](https://www.offene-werkstaetten.org/) and similar places (like [Fab Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab) and [Hackerspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace)) that are currently emerging around the world. While it is not an "official" [Fab Lab](https://www.fablabs.io/), it is nevertheless oriented towards the global *Fab Charter*, which puts a lot of emphasis on collaborative learning and sharing of responsibility in a community: 

> **What's in a fab lab?** Fab labs share an evolving inventory of core capabilities to make (almost) anything, allowing people and projects to be shared
>
> **Who can use a fab lab?** Fab labs are available as a community resource, offering open access for individuals as well as scheduled access for programs
>
> **What are your responsibilities?**  
> safety: not hurting people or machines  
> operations: assisting with cleaning, maintaining, and improving the lab  
> knowledge: contributing to documentation and instruction  
>
> **Who owns fab lab inventions?** Designs and processes developed in fab labs can be protected and sold however an inventor chooses, but should remain available for individuals to use and learn from
