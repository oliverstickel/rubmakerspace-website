# Vacancies

!!! info "Currently there are no vacancies in the RUB Makerspace." 

## Part-time Positions 

From time to time, part-time positions will be posted to provide general support to users and the team at the RUB Makerspace. Keep an eye on this section to stay up to date! 

## Unsolicited Applications

Unsolicited applications are welcome, but as a public employer we have no means to hire people "just like that". All positions that we offer are advertised and published on the university's job board and here. We are happy to [talk](kontakt.en.md) with people who would like to bring their own funding or make it through third-party funding applications. 

## Internships and Student Research Projects

In principle, internships and student research projects are possible with us. You can find more information [here](praktika.en.md).
