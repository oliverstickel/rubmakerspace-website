# Event-Calendar

!!! warning "Calendar Is Currently Not Available"
    For technical reasons, our calendar is unfortunately not available at the moment. We are working on getting it back online as soon as possible. We ask for your understanding. You can still reach us as usual via [contact](kontakt.en.md).

<!-- Below you will find public events in the Makerspace. To register and learn more, click on the corresponding entry in the calendar.  

!!! info "About our calendar"
    - Most of our [more specific instructions](unterweisungen.en.md) only take place upon [individual request](kontakt.en.md) and for small groups - so these events are usually not listed in the calendar. Please contact us if you are interested!
    - If you are hosting an event with us that you would like to have on the calendar, [feel free to let us know](kontakt.en.md).
    - You can also subscribe to our calendar [via this link](data/calendar.ics) directly in the app of your choice.
    - For organizational reasons, our calendar is only offered in German. To access it, please use a translation tool or [contact us](kontakt.en.md) if you need assistance.
