!!! info "Availability of Machines and Devices" 

	From time to time, certain machines and equipment may not be available for use due to renovations, expansions, maintenance, repairs or other similar reasons. This may be because they are out of order or require initial commissioning. If you require the use of specific equipment for your project, we ask that you contact the relevant contacts by email or telephone in advance to ensure availability.

Whether you need to drill, bend, mill, saw, weld, or press, our Metal Workshop provides the right machines, as well as competent guidance and support for your metalworking project.  

In our workshops, "Basics of Metalworking" and "Welding for Beginners," you can learn the basics of handling metalworking tools and start your first projects with confidence, while receiving expert support from our team. At our Metal Workshop, we encourage you to get involved and take on new challenges. Instead of saying "Hands off," we say: "Come here! Go for it! We will help you! Keep at it!"  

Once you have completed the necessary safety briefings, you are allowed to work independently in the Metal Workshop. Join the "Club of Metalworking" and let your creativity flow. :material-hammer-wrench:

## How to use the Metal Workshop

In order to work in the Metal Workshop, you must first have attended the [General Safety Instruction](unterweisungen.en.md) and then receive instruction and training for the respective application (for example, milling or drilling). Many devices require experience in handling and therefore we only let you work independently on the machines after detailed instruction.
If you want to use our Metal Workshop, just let us know on site or [contact](kontakt.en.md) us.

To work in our Metal Workshop, you must first attend the [General Safety Instruction](unterweisungen.en.md) and receive training for the specific equipment or application you wish to use, such as milling or drilling. Many of the machines in the Metal Workshop require experience and expertise to operate safely and effectively, so we only allow individuals to work independently after they have received detailed instruction and training.

Below you will find a detailed description of each of these areas.

## Sheet Metal Working {: #blech }

Bending is a manufacturing process in which a bending moment is applied to the material, causing a plastic, permanent deformation. 
When bending sheet metal, the shape is changed by folding it over.

## Stationary Drilling Machines {: #bohren }

To drill a hole in solid material, a stationary drilling machine is very suitable. Here you can drill into a wide variety of materials. Whether steel, aluminum or plastic. 

![A close up of our stationary drilling machine, Optidrill DH28BV. @RUB-Makerspace: Standbohrmaschine (CC BY-SA 4.0).](medien/RUB-Makerspace_Metallwerkstatt_Standbohrmaschine_CC-BY-SA-40.jpg)

- [Bench Drill UNIMAX 1 TAP](https://maxion.de/home/produkte/tischbohrmaschinen/unimax-1-tap/)

## Lathing {: #drehen }

Lathing is the exciting machining of round parts. So you can make round parts with offsets and curves on lathes.


![@RUB-Makerspace: Drehen (CC BY-SA 4.0).](medien/RUB-Makerspace_Metallwerkstatt_Drehen_CC-BY-SA-40.jpg)

## Milling Machines {: #fraesen }

Milling produces parts with flat surfaces or contours. Not every part can be produced in 3D printing. Straight components made of steel, aluminum, brass and copper are milled. Plastics can also be milled.

![The photo shows our Avia FNX 30PNC milling machine. In the focus is its control unit. @RUB-Makerspace: Fräsen (CC BY-SA 4.0).](medien/RUB-Makerspace_Metallwerkstatt_Fraesen_CC-BY-SA-40.jpg)

## Measuring and Testing {: #messen }

If a component is also to function in assembly, measuring and checking the required dimensions is very important. In our Basic Workshop you will learn to recognize the dimensions. 

![On the right side in the focus of the picture is a Mitutoyo measuring device on a work table. Other than that, a few small boxes and other tools are spread out on the table. On the left side of the photo, one of the doors of the metal workshop can be seen. @RUB-Makerspace: Messen (CC BY-SA 4.0).](medien/RUB-Makerspace_Metallwerkstatt_Messen_CC-BY-SA-40.jpg)

**Our Devices (*Links lead to the manufacturer's website*):** 

- [Mitutoyo Measuring Device](https://shop.mitutoyo.ch/web/mitutoyo/de_CH/mitutoyo/01.03.05.031/Nur%20f%C3%BCr%20Web/$catalogue/mitutoyoData/PR/518-351D-21/index.xhtml;jsessionid=C3B2314D4FEA26CAA5A579460BBCD050)
- Various hand-held measuring devices (measuring screws, gauges and so on)

## Pressing {: #pressen }

Sometimes you also need to press two workpieces together. Pressing is very well suited for this. In advance, of course, the components must be manufactured so that the process also works.

![The focus is on the Compac 25t workshop press in the center. Behind it, windows allow a view of the parking lot behind the Makerspace. @RUB-Makerspace: Presse (CC BY-SA 4.0).](medien/RUB-Makerspace_Metallwerkstatt_Pressen_CC-BY-SA-40.jpg)

	- Pressure 25 tons
	- Stroke 240 mm

## Welding / Thermal Cutting {: #schweissen }

Welding permits a wide range of design possibilities. In general, welded constructions are material-saving, simple and quick to manufacture, and thus cost-effective. For joining metals, welding is generally the best non-detachable connection. 

![The photo shows our welding corner. It can be separated from the rest of the metal workshop with red curtains. In the middle is a welding table on which various tools lie. @RUB-Makerspace: Schweissen (CC BY-SA 4.0)](medien/RUB-Makerspace_Metallwerkstatt_Schweissen_CC-BY-SA-40.jpg)
