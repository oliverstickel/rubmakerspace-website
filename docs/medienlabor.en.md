## Photo and Video Cameras {: #foto }

Our photo studio offers a wide selection of SLR cameras that are capable of recording videos as well. We also provide professional accessories such as different lenses, tripods, a light tent, photo flashes with a vast selection of light shapers, light meters, and even a camera crane. 

Nowadays, 360° content is becoming increasingly popular in various areas such as home tours, exploratory tours, product marketing, and immersive virtual reality videos. 

[Here's an application example: a 360° digital tour of the RUB campus.](https://studium.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/de/digitale-campustour)

If you're interested in our **VR/AR equipment** in addition to the 360° cameras, you can find more information [here](designlabor.en.md#mr)!

## Media Production {: #edit }

Nothing works today without software. Whether it's film editing, streaming, sound editing... The possibilities are endless. With us, you have access to popular open source software as well as professional programs from established manufacturers. Since video projects and 360° recordings can demand a bit more from your computer hardware, we offer you the possibility to edit your projects directly on site on powerful systems. [Here](digitallabor.en.md#computer-and-it) you can find information about our laptops and desktop workstations.
