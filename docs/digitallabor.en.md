## Soldering and General Electrical Lab Work

One of the most common activities in the digital lab is [soldering](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6ten). The equipment includes several classic soldering stations, solder fume extractors, a hot air soldering station and various soldering tools, such as a third hand with illuminated magnifier. These things are mainly set up on two large mobile lab tables (see photo at the top of this page), which can be used for various electrical work. Mobile soldering irons with small exhaust, work mat and so on for location-flexible soldering with groups are also available.

## Measuring and Checking

To support the manufacturing process, to check their functionality or to find errors, there are various measuring devices in the Makerspace on the subject of electricity - but also on other measured values.

## Manufacture Circuit Boards

With our circuit board printer you can print, solder, bake and drill circuit boards. The printing plate offers you a space of up to 128mm x 116mm to print your PCB drawing on a printed circuit board, drill the necessary holes and apply components directly. 

In addition it is possible to use the [desktop milling machine](kunststoffwerkstatt.en.md#cnc-machining) from the plastics workshop for [insulation milling](https://wiki.edu.vn/wiki10/2020/12/11/leiterplattenfrasen-wikipedia/). The milling machine provides a workspace up to 203,2mm x 152,4mm x 60,5mm as well as various milling tools such as milling cutters, gravers and drills. 

![In the middle of the photo you can see our platinum printer. All kinds of supplies are arranged around it. In the background is soldering tool. @RUB-Makerspace: Voltera (CC BY-SA 4.0)](medien/RUB-Makerspace_Voltera_CC-BY-SA-40.jpg)

??? abstract "Particularities Voltera platinum printer"

   	Although the aim of the device is the rapid prototyping of printed circuit boards, our experience to date shows that the machine is quite temperamental and that printing with liquid ink and the further process steps certainly carry some potential for error. Unfortunately, this is sometimes the case with new types of equipment and processes. We therefore do not currently recommend relying on the device for time-critical applications and see it more as an interesting research device and certainly as an alternative application, for example in the high-precision dispensing of liquids.

## Pick and Place - Assembling Circuit Bards
In the digital lab it will soon be possible to assamble circuit boards automatically. The required Pick and Place Machine for this process is being purchased right now. Attachments for applying solder paste on circuit boards via patterns are already available and we are currently considering to purchase or build a manually operated placement tool for components.

**Our devices (*links lead to the manufacter's website*):**

- [Opulo LumenPnP](https://opulo.io/products/lumenpnp) (purchased right now)
- 10x automatic Feeder


## Reflow Oven
In our small, digitally operated oven circuit boards can be soldered with the [reflow-soldering method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflow_soldering). During this process the different components are not being soldered indivually with common solder but they are being soldered all at once with soldering paste. The soldering paste is applied to the circuit board as well as the remaining components and then - completely equiped - it will be soldered in the oven.  
The reflow oven can also be usefull to repair circuit boards, in case there is the assumption that the problem is caused by broken soldering points.

## Borrowing and Class/Group sets
Besides the general possibility to [borrow](ausleihe.en.md) equipment from the digital lab we also have some special offers. 

On the one hand we can provide members of Ruhr University Bochum with mobile data hotspot ["Freifunk-in-a-Box"](https://freifunk.net/en/) with a flat rate. 
On the other hand we offer various sets of hardware for classes or groups to work with. On demand we can also offer safety instructions for teachers or workshop leaders: "train the trainers".

Can be expanded with further components for the needs of other/higher classes on demand.  
- [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/): 10 Pieces including USB-Cables and further components on demand. For 10-30 persons. 
- On demand further sets can be compiled individually as required.

## Material, Parts and Supplies

![@Michael Schwettmann](medien/RUB-Makerspace_Lager-Digitallabor_CC-BY-SA-40.jpg)

The digital lab usually keeps needed materials from computer and electrical engineering in stock. This concerns in particular 

- Consumables (stranded wire, soldering material, ...)
- IT accessories (adapters, cables, storage media, ...)
- Standard components (LEDs, resistors, power supplies, ...)
- Microcontrollers and single board computers (e.g. various Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, BBC micro:bit, Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, D1, ESP8266, ESP32, ...)
- Various "breakout" boards and accessories for microcontrollers
- Various sensors and actuators, e.g. for connection to microcontrollers
- Various hardware for cannibalization. There is also a "Learn to Solder" box for broken things, but still good for learning/trying different soldering jobs.


## Workshops 
Here you can find some of our workshops for groups that we offer on demand. We also have other workshopconcepts e.g. about [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) or about soldering in a software that we will provide little by little on this website as an [open educational ressource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources). Furthermore you can [contact us](kontakt.en.md) if you want a new workshop concept developed by us as a [service](dienstleistungen.en.md) or if you want to collaborate in another form of [cooperation](zielgruppen.en.md).

## Sensor Data 

We installed (environmental) sensors on different locations of the makerspace. The most of them are air data sensors based on [sensor.community](https://sensor.community) (particle pollution, humidity, temperature)

!!! imoprtant "About the Quality of the Data" 
The collected data is recorded automatically. The data are unadjusted based on diy solutions with low priced components - the data is not inspected. The displayed data about temperature for example are generally higher than the actual ambient temperature, which is caused by the lost heat of the electronic components. Furthermore, the sensors are not activated permanently, they maybe temporary lose the connection or get accidentally unplugged. Please keep this in mind while you view the data.
