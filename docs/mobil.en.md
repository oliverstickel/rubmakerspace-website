??? warning "Our Mobile Makerspaces are still under construction - click for more information."

    Our RUB Makerspace has two vehicles that serve as mobile makerspaces. These vehicles can be used for workshops and events in the field, or for representative purposes and transportation of staff and materials. However, both our vehicles are still ongoing projects, and we are continuously working to improve and expand their capabilities.

## VW Crafter 

The VW Crafter, previously used by the RUB post office, has been transformed into a mobile makerspace with a roof terrace, awning, wooden interior with benches and lighting, and a colorful makeover. While it already has basic equipment, we plan to add modules for different tools and machines in the future. This vehicle is perfect for taking a large amount of material out into the field and can function as a self-sufficient exhibition stand.

## Piaggio Ape 

The Piaggio Ape, converted to electric propulsion, is perhaps the smallest mobile makerspace in the world. Its rear body can be unfolded to create a booth for workshops and trade show appearances. Although it has a functional body, it currently has no interior equipment with tools and modules. However, we are working on adding these in the future. We hope to use the Ape regularly on campus and transport it in the Crafter for longer distances and larger trade show setups. This vehicle is perfect for small but eye-catching and high-profile events in the immediate vicinity.
