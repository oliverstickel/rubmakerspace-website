# Safety Instructions

Before you are allowed to work in the RUB Makerspace, you need to attend at least and as a first step the *General Safety Instruction*. After that, you may work in the workshop areas and use tools as instructed (e.g. use of hand tools).  

Building on this, various *special instruction* can be given as required. For example, there is a collective instruction for the [Digital Lab](digitallabor.en.md) or individual instructions for operating the [laser cutter](designlabor.en.md#laser), [3D printers](designlabor.en.md#fdm) and all other hazardous areas and machines in the Makerspace.  

!!! warning "All instructions are valid for a maximum of one year (max. 6 months for minors)."

!!! info "Instruction and briefing in interaction"
	Every complete instruction process includes not only the pure *safety instruction*, but also the individual arrangement for further *instruction*, i.e. the **practical** learning of everything that belongs to the safe operation of the work area in question. The type and scope of the instruction depend very much on the respective previous knowledge and the work area concerned - they are therefore discussed individually.


## Exception: Guests

The obligation to undergo instruction does not apply to guests who are allowed to stay in the RUB Makerspace - e.g. to participate in guided tours, events or to use the [co-working area](coworking.en.md) - even without formal instruction. However, guests are only allowed to perform "household" activities - e.g. working with their own laptop or using whiteboards and creative materials.


## When and How?

General Safety Instruction can be completed during [business hours](oeffnungszeiten.en.md) at set times. Currently, the briefings are held weekly, alternating **Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:30** am. You can also find the exact dates in our [calendar](kalender.en.md).

!!! info "Special instructions, first steps, and individual packages"
	- For special instructions [please contact us individually with your needs](kontakt.en.md)! 
	- Please discuss with the person responsible for the respective area, how your first steps in handling the machine will look like, **before** you work independently. Preferably before, during, but no later than at the end of your instruction.
	- For courses and, depending on capacity, possibly also for other (university) formats, instruction packages can be put together specifically and held at the appropriate time in the course.
