## Assembly Zone and Hands-on Seminar Room

The [assembly zone](../coworking.en/#montagezone) is (also) the common "bench workroom" of all workshops in the basement. So you have the possibility to extend activities from the workshops there. The assembly zone is, for example, well suited for workshops with larger groups, to work on projects that require a lot of space - or to simply build your own project while enjoying each other's company.

!!! warning "Observe mutual consideration and safety!"

	The assembly zone is a **common** co-working space and a transit area (e.g. for everyone coming from the ground floor to the basement). Therefore, special consideration is required. Accordingly, dangerous, particularly noisy or highly dusty work is not permitted in the assembly zone. 

	This does not mean that a hammer, a file, a cordless screwdriver and similar tools may not be used during the assembly and processing of a project. However, it is not permitted (there), for example, to use a belt sander to properly sand down material, to flex iron rods, to weld, to handle paints or resins, or anything else like that. 

There's also our [hands-on seminar room](projektraeume.en.md#praxisseminarraum), which is suitable for various craft work by small to medium (seminar) groups. It can be flexibly furnished and equipped and is directly connected to the workshops.
