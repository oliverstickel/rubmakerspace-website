# Open Makerspace


Our general opening hours are called *Open Makerspace*. During these hours, our door is open to everyone. More about this and formats outside of the Open Makerspace can be found at [opening hours](oeffnungszeiten.en.md).

??? question "What makes the Open Makerspace special?"
    During our Open Makerspace hours, our team members are available to assist you with any questions or concerns, and provide supervision and first aid if necessary. Our reception desk is staffed during these hours, and you can also approach any team member wearing a colorful Makerspace shirt. However, our ultimate goal is to foster a sense of community among all makers. We encourage collaboration, sharing of ideas, and support for each other's projects. Our Open Makerspace is a space where creative minds can come together, share their skills, and work together to bring their ideas to life.

## Workshop for Makers
At the Open Makerspace, individuals who have completed our [safety training program](unterweisungen.en.md) are welcome to use our [workspaces and equipment](ort.en.md) to create their projects. However, since some equipment is used frequently and requires specific preparation, supervision, and security measures, we highly recommend that you contact us as early as possible with your request or [register](#anmeldung) beforehand.

!!! warning "Please note that without registration, access to popular, complex, or potentially hazardous areas (such as the laser cutter, CNC lathe, etc.) is usually not be possible."


## Co-working for Guests

During opening hours, you can of course drop by without working in the workshops or on machines. Use our [co-working areas](coworking.en.md) to work or exchange ideas with other people. 

!!! info "Guests don't need a formal safety instruction."

    If you "only" move as a guest in the public areas and don't touch any machines or equipment, you don't need the safety instruction. **Please still check out our flyer for general overview and safety in the Makerspace.** You can find it at [safety](sicherheit.en.md) and on display in the Makerspace.
