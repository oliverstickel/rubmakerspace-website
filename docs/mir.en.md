# Maker in Residence

The Ruhr region needs new ideas and support to promote change and students interested in starting a business or innovation-oriented scientists are at the forefront of this development. We want to invite international experts who bring personality, talent and knowledge with them to benefit the people in the RUB Makerspace with their experience.

## The Core of the Project

Once a year, for a period of up to 10 weeks, one *Maker in Residence* will become part of the team at the RUB-Makerspace and will be compensated with funds for accommodation, materials, etc. as well as an honorarium. The task of these *residents* is then to share their professional or creative knowledge with the groups in the Makerspace, to (jointly) create works, to initiate innovative projects and workshops and to "bring in new wind". Classical disciplinary boundaries should also be broken down, and new ways of thinking can be explored.

## Makers in Residence Worldwide

The concept of *makers* or *artists in residence* is not new. Inviting and supporting innovative minds to work from their own workshop or studio is an idea that has been around since Leonardo da Vinci. There's a reason for that - it's a *good* idea that can bring a lot of benefits and long-lasting reverberations to all those directly and indirectly involved. 

Some examples of *makers in residence* from around the world in recent years include:

- The European Commission runs a Makerspace in its "Joint Research Center" and offers a [Makers-in-Residence program there](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-makerspace/jrc-makers-residence-programme/makers-and-projects-jrc-makers-residence-edition-1_en).
- The [Residency program](https://lab64.stanford.edu/makers-in-residence) of Lab64 - the Makerspace at the memorable Stanford University in Silicon Valley.
- The Australian National University offers three months access to their makerspace as [residents](https://makerspace.anu.edu.au/page/residency.html) to any external person who has a project idea. 
- The Chicago Public Library advertises spaces for [makers in residence](https://www.chipublib.org/news/2022-makers-in-residence/) each year. A public exhibition is created from the *residents'* work.
