=== "About Me"

	>"I am Flo. I represent Dirk as general manager in his absence and am responsible for the [Design Lab](designlabor.en.md) in the Makerspace. There are many things there that are also in most other FabLabs and Makerspaces, such as FDM 3D printers, laser cutters or VR equipment. I am also our connection to the start-up and founding consultancy of the [Worldfactory](https://www.worldfactory.de/en/consulting/start-up-consultancy).
	With my degree in Industrial Design, I support founders there with technical production know-how and methods from Design Thinking in the development of their research-based products and services.
	During my studies, I also founded the Stadtteilfabrik (district factory) and as a result, I am now and then on the road independently with lectures, installations and workshops on design, founding and design thinking."
