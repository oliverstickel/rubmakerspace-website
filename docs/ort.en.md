# Interactive Map of the Makerspace

Following the motto "Make Almost Anything", you can design and create (almost) all kinds of things in the Makerspace. On these pages and on our map, you can find out what workspaces and equipment we have and will have in the future. Click on one of the areas on the map to go directly to the corresponding info page!

The RUB Makerspace is located on the [Mark 51Â°7 campus](https://www.mark51-7.de/) uwhich is currently being developed around us under the motto "Knowledge Creates Economy". We are situated in the former [Opel Administration Building](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Opel_AG_Werk_Bochum_I).

We have about 2000 square meters of space on two floors and have plenty of room for innovative ideas in teaching, prototyping for start-ups, creative development projects in studies and research or for exchange.   

You can get an impression of us in our video [Welcome to the Makerspace](https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4iOvnHY8l8).
