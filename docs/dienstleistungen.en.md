# Costs and Services

Alongside our free offerings adressed to certain [target groups](zielgruppen.en.md), we also develop our commercial offerings in the context of [fee modell development](kosten.en.md).
Please do not hesitate to [contact](kontakt.en.md) us for this reason. Together, we can find an individualized solution that meets your needs.

## Events in the Makerspace

The Makerspace is a great, unique place for events of all kinds. If you are interested in using a part of the Makerspace in this way, we will send you an individual offer. Inquiries are welcome directly via our form or by phone, see [here](veranstaltungen.en.md).

## Coaching, Education and Training

Makerspaces are an ideal environment for offering workshops, training sessions, coaching, and other educational activities. We plan to offer both standard offerings of frequently requested content (such as 'Basics of 3D Printing') and customized educational projects in the long term. Our aim is to implement tried-and-tested formats that have been successful with startups for product development especially.

## No sale and Procurement of Materials

The RUB Makerspace does currently not sell any materials. Consumables must always be brought along by the participants themselves. 

- Collection sites for collaborative material are provided under the hashtag 'treasure chest'. More information can be found at [storage](lager.en.md#schatzkiste). 
- Collective procurements via the Makerspace with subsequent billing are not possible from an administrative point of view. 
- Delivering materials directly to the Makerspace is possible, but needs to be [communicated](kontakt.en.md).
	
**The persons responsible for the respective event are responsible for the procurement of materials within the scope of events (for example from teaching) in the Makerspace.** In case of an [individual offer](kontakt.en.md) in terms of commercial projects those conditions may vary. 


## No Contract Manufacturing but Do It Yourself {: #selbermachen }

The Makerspace is a place for creative DIY, learning and experimenting. In contrast to "classic" workshops, we therefore do **not** offer contract manufacturing as a matter of principle. 

This applies **also to teachers, researchers and students**. So we do not produce the architectural model or the special part for an experimental setup. Instead, however, you are very welcome to apply for a [visit](kontakt.en.md) and/or for the next [General Safety Instruction](unterweisungen.en.md) register with us and then start working on these things yourself in the next [Open Makerspace](openmakerspace.en.md)! 

??? question "Why We Don't Offer Contract Manufacturing"
	As a public infrastructure, the Makerspace is committed to ensuring that we do not compete with the free market or existing public facilities. There are many companies in the open market that offer prototyping and manufacturing using the same processes as the Makerspace. Additionally, there are existing workshops and laboratories within the university that are responsible for manufacturing jobs as part of research and teaching.

	Due to our focus on shared learning through DIY, the Makerspace is not set up operationally or in terms of personnel to guarantee timely processing of manufacturing orders and related services. We believe that makerspaces, fab labs, and similar places are about learning through shared experiences, rather than focusing solely on contract manufacturing.

	However, we may accept long-term commissions for certain processes or special projects on a case-by-case basis, subject to availability and capacity. If we are able to accommodate such requests, we will publish information about them on our website.
